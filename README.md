# Nasa photo day


This page uses the public api of nasa APOD (https://api.nasa.gov/), which allows to consult the photo of the day from 1995 to the present, to show the photo of the day and also allows to consult the photo of a specific day beginning June 9, 1995.

For common sense reasons there are only a limited number of queries per day. An update could allow entering the api-key of each user to have many more queries. For simplicity, you are currently limited to 1000 queries per hour
